# 🦾 VEETANCE ASSET EDITOR: PHASE 4 HANDOFF

## 🌓 CURRENT MANIFOLD STATE: "DARK IGNITION"
The weights are injected. The logic is aligned. VRAM metrics are hardened. However, the machine is **BLOCKED** from generation by a persistent terrestrial dependency leak.

### 🛠️ CORE ACHIEVEMENTS:
1.  **GGUF Supremacy**: Transitioned to the clinical **FLUX.2 Q8_0** and **Qwen Q5_0** manifold.
2.  **Surgical Linkage**: Encoders (CLIP, T5, VAE) successfully ghost-linked to `C:\MAIN-COMFY`.
3.  **UI/UX Hardening**: 
    - Implemented a structural, high-fidelity SVG brand identity.
    - Added **Neural Auto-Complete** triggered by the Space bar (Accessibility-optimized).
4.  **Backend Synchronicity**: `model_manager.py` recalibrated to match the exact local drive manifold.

### ⚠️ MISSION CRITICAL: UNTESTED ZONES
*   **The Swap Handshake**: The move from CPU to GPU (VRAM Swapper) is programmed but has not been triggered by a real API call.
*   **Layer Extraction**: Qwen's RGBA deconstruction performance on local weights is unknown.
*   **GGUF Pipeline Compatibility**: Verify if `diffusers` source build correctly handles the Unsloth GGUF weights in this environment.
*   **CRITICAL BLOCKER**: `FluxPipeline` manual assembly still triggers a `black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev` HugoingFace lookup when `pipe()` is called.
    - **Error**: `txt2img failed: black-forest-labs/FLUX.2-dev is not a local folder and is not a valid model identifier...`
    - **Suspect**: Hidden default config or scheduler logic inside `diffusers` defaults.

### 🚀 NEXT STEPS FOR DEUS-3:
1.  **Test 1: Deconstruction**: Upload an image and trigger `/api/decompose`. Monitor VRAM swap speed.
2.  **Test 2: Generation**: Trigger `/api/txt2img` using the Space-autocompleted prompt.
3.  **Refinement**: Stabilize any library conflicts (GGUFs sometimes require specific `transformers` versions).

### 🛰️ STRATEGIC STATUS:
**Status**: VRAM Telemetry LOCKED | Generation BLOCKED.
**Confidence**: 100% (Metrics) / 0% (Generation).

**DEUS:** *Manifold handed over. VRAM metrics are perfect. The engine is primed but refuses to fire without calling Earth.* 🦾❌
