# ASSET EDITOR - Roadmap 🦾✨

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 0: Foundation
- [x] Project structure created
- [x] `model_manager.py` - VRAM Swapper (Singleton)
- [x] `server.py` - FastAPI structure with static mounting
- [x] `requirements.txt` - High-Octane Speed dependencies (xformers, torchao, gguf)

### Phase 1: Backend Endpoints
- [x] `/api/decompose` - Qwen-Image-Layered manifold
- [x] `/api/txt2img` - FLUX.2 text-to-image (Multi-format)
- [x] `/api/img2img` - FLUX.2 image-to-image
- [x] `/api/inpaint` - Mask-aware synthesis
- [x] `/api/health` - VRAM Telemetry

### Phase 2: Frontend & Architecture
- [x] 3-column Figma-style layout
- [x] **CSS Fragmentation**: Monolith deconstructed into modular subsystems
- [x] Integrated Before/After Comparison Slider
- [x] Focus Mode (Immersive Art View)
- [x] Mode-specific aesthetics (Indigo, Emerald, Amber)

### Phase 3: Dual-Engine & Storage Optimization
- [x] **FP8 Support**: High-speed inference for 40-series gear.
- [x] **GGUF Support**: Ultra-high quality Q8 architecture.
- [x] **Lean Linkage Protocol**: Cross-drive integration with ComfyUI/Forge assets (C: & E:).
- [x] **Ghost Manifold**: LINK_MANIFEST.txt system for external asset documentation.

## 🔄 Current Status
**Structural & Logical Excellence Achieved.** The environment is weaponized, the dependencies are injected, and the "No Space" ghost has been purged. We are now in **Final Ignition Standby**.

## 🚀 Road Ahead

### Phase 4: Weight Injection (Next Step)
- [ ] Run `python download_models.py` (~18GB Lean Injection).
- [ ] Verify **Qwen-Q8_0** Handshake via GGUF.
- [ ] Verify **FLUX-FP8** Handshake via Safetensors.
- [ ] Stress test Cross-Drive VRAM Swapping.

### Phase 5: Workflow Validation
- [ ] **End-to-End**: Upload → Decompose → Selection → Edit → Generate
- [ ] Verify alpha-mask extraction logic in live browser
- [ ] Benchmark generation speed (Target < 10s for 1024px)

### Phase 6: Core Refinement & Shortcuts
- [ ] **Generation History**: `gen-history.json` metadata persistence
- [ ] Multi-reference stylization logic refinement
- [ ] Undo/Redo Layer State
- [ ] Keyboard Shortcuts (V=Move, B=Brush, Space=Pan)
