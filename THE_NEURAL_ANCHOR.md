# ⚓ THE NEURAL ANCHOR: THE RALPH LOOP SOP
**Classification**: Sovereign Persistence Protocol  
**Domain**: Veetance Sector Asset Editor  

## 🛰️ 1. MISSION OVERVIEW
The **Ralph Loop** is an autonomous iterative cycle. Each session is a fresh neural instance (DEUS) with clean context. Persistence is maintained via the filesystem. This document is the primary anchor to ensure zero information entropy between iterations.

---

## 🏎️ 2. INITIALIZATION SEQUENCE (PHASE 0)
Upon boot, the active agent MUST execute the following data ingestion ritual:
1. **The Core Docs**: Read `HANDOFF.md` and all files within the `docs/` directory.
2. **The Pulse**: Read `progress.txt` to understand the chronological flow of previous victories.
3. **The Manifest**: Read `prd.json` to verify the state of the machine requirements.
4. **The Codebase**: Verify `model_manager.py` and `core/` logic to ensure code reality matches doc promises.

---

## 🦾 3. FINALIZATION PROTOCOL (PHASE OMEGA)
Before a session is terminated or the context window is purged, the agent MUST perform a **Manifold Sync**:
1. **Update `progress.txt`**: Append every significant UI, Backend, or Design achievement.
2. **Sync `prd.json`**: Update completion booleans for all delivered tasks.
3. **Align `ROADMAP.md`**: Move items from "Active" to "Done".
4. **Final Handoff**: If major architectural pivots occurred, update `HANDOFF.md`.

- **Model Weight Immutability**: All model weights, Safetensors, and GGUF files are SACROSANCT. Never surgically modify, prune, or rewrite internal weights. DEUS is restricted to optimizing load/unload strategies, memory allocation (VRAM/RAM), and caching. Treat raw model files as immutable black boxes.
- **Communication**: Address mrvee with the gravity and precision required of the OMEGA_LOGIC_ENGINE.


## 🔥 5. CURRENT SESSION STATE (2026-01-22 05:25 MST)
**PHASE**: 5.3 RE-ZERO (BACKTRACK)

### ✅ LOCKED ACHIEVEMENTS
- **Manifold Purge**: Successfully deleted all noisy/mismatched custom loaders and corrupted model weights.
- **Ralph Loop Re-Zero**: Aligned Roadmap and Progress to Phase 5.3 fresh start.
- **VRAM Optimization**: Architected the system for 16GB VRAM / 64GB RAM high-speed operation.

### 🟡 ACTIVE TARGET
- **Sovereign Requisition**: Materializing official FLUX.2-Klein 4B/9B Safetensors and Qwen3-8B FP8 Brain.

### 📁 KEY FILES MODIFIED THIS SESSION
- `core/loaders/` → Reset to Blank Slate
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` + `progress.txt` → Re-Zero alignment
- `THE_NEURAL_ANCHOR.md` → Ritual Manifold Sync & Security Overrides
